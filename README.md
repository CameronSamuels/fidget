# Note from the developer
Made by me, [Cameron Samuels](https://cameronsamuels.com), in April 2017, a month before the Fidget Spinner's popularity peak: May 2017. Everyone I knew that I told about the prototype of this app said, "no one will ever download your app". And it looks like they were wrong. Over 600,000 downloads in just 2 months. Incredible. Think of the number 1,000. Do you know 1,000 people? What about 10,000? Can you even remember 1,000 names from the top of your head? Incredible.
